# Advent of Code 2020

## What is advent of code?
Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that 
can be solved in any programming language you like. To check out the puzzles go to 
[https://adventofcode.com/](https://adventofcode.com/)

## What is this repo

This is just my attempt at the puzzles. I've decided to do them in Node.js. If I get time I will also do them in 
another language or languages as well, but I'm not sure how much time I will have to do that.

## Looking for solutions

If you're coming to this repo just to grab the answers, please try to solve the problem yourself before looking
for answers. This repo is more for my benefit, but you are more than welcome to peruse it. Please note however I may 
not have refined my code to be 100% efficient.
